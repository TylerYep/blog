# Introduction
Hi, I'm Tyler, and this is my blog!

I'm starting this blog as I enter my senior year at Stanford University. I'm hoping to write some posts about the things I've worked on over the past four years, and continue writing posts about what I do in the future.

# Why Keep a Blog?

I debated for a long time whether making a blog was worthwhile. I'm not obsessed with the idea of having a ton of followers or maintaining a large reader-base, and I haven't really done anything revolutionary in the first 20 years of my life.

So why keep a blog? What's the purpose of making my thoughts public, and writing posts about what I'm up to, if I don't want the public image?

**This blog is more for me.**

Writing up posts to remember what I've worked on. Creating tutorials on subjects I spend countless hours trying to understand, and helping me remember all of that work and use it in the future. Every post will be a snapshot of my knowledge showing what I've learned over my various projects. Maybe it can be a chance for me to get some feedback on my work too, and learn something new.

# Welcome Home!

This blog invites you into my life, allowing you see what I think about and what I find exciting about my work. I hope you find something that interests you or sparks something creative.

Make yourself at home :)
