## About Me

Hello, I'm Tyler! I'm from San Jose, California.

I am currently in my 4<sup>th</sup> year of studying Computer Science at Stanford University, and I also plan to finish my Coterminal Master's in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning.

I'm interested in impactful and brilliant ideas in the intersection between design and artificial intelligence. I love looking at details no one else notices and enjoying the incredible impacts these details have in the designs, products, and technology that we interact with every day.
